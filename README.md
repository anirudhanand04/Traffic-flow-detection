# Traffic Flow Detection

Description

The project name is traffic flow prediction using kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/coplin/traffic). Google colaboratory notebook is available. In this task I managed to apply my knowledge in the data science field such as data pre-processing ( data cleaning, outlier detection, data formatting) and use exploratory data analytics techniques to find out patterns among features. Moreover, I applied a machine learning regressor model together with Deep Learning LSTM model.
Techniques

    Exploratory Data Analysis
    Machine Learning and Data Visualization
    Deep Learning (LSTM)
